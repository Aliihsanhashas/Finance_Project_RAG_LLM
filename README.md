## AI Finance Advisor


## ðŸ§  Project Description

This project aims to develop an AI-powered financial investment advisor application to assist users in making informed financial decisions. The application utilizes the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** method to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on user queries.

Through RAG, information dynamically retrieved from various sourcesâ€”such as news articles, stock data, and company disclosures from the Public Disclosure Platform (KAP)â€”is processed and tailored to meet the user's needs. **Prompt Engineering** techniques are employed to help the language model better understand queries and deliver more relevant responses.

To determine appropriate Python function parameters and access the correct data sources, the system leverages **Function Calling** mechanisms. While news is fetched via news APIs, company disclosures are stored in **Vector Databases** and accessed through semantic search techniques. **Chunking** methods are applied to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of searches within the vector database.

The application analyzes user queries, sends requests to relevant APIs, retrieves data, and generates comprehensive investment reports. These reports include a combination of stock performance analysis, financial statements, and news content.

The primary goal of the project is to offer a fast and reliable platform for accessing financial information, helping investors make better-informed decisions. With the integration of AI techniques, the application not only presents information but also delivers intelligent, context-aware responses tailored to usersâ€™ specific questions and needs.
